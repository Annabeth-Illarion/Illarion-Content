-- Background:
-- “The funny thing about beliefs is that every now and then someone is stupid enough to
-- believe in them.”

-- While Gavin Northstar was a young girl her parents filled her mind with stories of dwarves and
-- dragons, good and evil, right and wrong. Gavin envisioned herself a hero and dedicated her
-- life to being so. There was no choice in her mind but to do what is right. She is always
-- reconsidering her assumptions and carefully molding herself to be a sharp axe for justice. She
-- can’t stand to be in the wrong. In the times she does mess up, she is quick to apologize;
-- though Gavin messing up is a one in 50 year event. Gavin honed her body by working out with
-- the guys. She surpassed them in muscle and in height as if the gods were smiling on her
-- determination.

-- She joined the Civil Watch as a foot soldier. In her early days in the watch
-- Gavin saw a girl on the streets. There were a lot of homeless in the area. She had often spared
-- them some pocket copper, however seeing a young girl on the streets broke Gavin’s heart.
-- She invited the girl to her house. The girl sheepishly declined several times. Gavin however did
-- not take no for an answer. She lifted the girl by her arm and led her to Gavin’s house. She fed
-- the girl and told her she can stay there for a while. The two became close friends. Bre, who
-- was more laid back and cheery, joined the Civil Watch in order to follow Gavin. They both rose
-- in the ranks higher than most in the Civil Watch.

-- During their friendship Gavin and Bre slit open their wrists till blood wrung out. They tied their
-- arms together and from then on they considered each other sisters.
