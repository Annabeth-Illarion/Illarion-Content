--Personality: carefree callous, flirtatious suave

--Background
--The longest surviving and oldest of the human Warsages Apple has grown a little more carefree than his companions.

--entrance into the order; however Apple has sex with them and sends them off to their death like any other who tries to join.

--Apple was born one of Runewick’s aristocrats. He studied with the best magic and knowledge tutors and fought
--with some of the best trainers. He chose life magic because it seemed refined and later switched to necromancy

--sent to kill him. Apple killed her and sent the head back the fallen sage’s head and a parchment containing a proposal.
--If they would accept him as the new Lifesage, he would disband his group and serve Runewick. Recognizing his power the Archmage
-- decided to allow it.
