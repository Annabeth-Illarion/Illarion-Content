-- Background: Francois started out as a girl to a Short and robust merchant father and a mother who was tall and thin. Francois came out as tall and thin with broad shoulders. As she grew she got picked on for her height and then for her very tiny breast.
-- Her Father's only daughter she was raised to follow him in the merchant guild. From a young age she was given a tutor and received lessons every day. Her father often had visitors, usually old friends and clients. In Francois teens a female warrior was invited to the house. Mr. Delacroix ordered Francois to host the warrior, to show her around town and provide her with anything she needed. On the third night of the warrior's stay she showed François love. Over the week they repeatedly made love until Fancois's mother walked in on them.
-- The Warrior made a quick escape. Francois was then thrown out of the house. She left the village to shame. Francois got a job working in some field until she mustered enough money to follow be allowed to follow a caravan to Runewick. She did not speak to anyone on her trek. During her travel Francois got the epiphany to become a man. She binded what little breast she had, started speaking in a deeper tone and switched to guy clothes.. As a girl she was ugly, but as a guy she was quite pretty, with a feminine charm.
-- As a he Francois felt a never before felt wave of confidence. When Francois arrived in Runewick he let it known that he known that he was a skilled merchant. Once his knowledge was demonstrated he had no problem starting a debt to purchase goods.
-- Money wise Francois is doing good, but his youth is growing thin. He yearns for a mate and passively lingers the thought if she wants to be with a guy or a girl.
-- Personality: Gentle, sweet, talented sales person, charismatic, outgoing on the outside, but lonely and self-conscious on the inside.
