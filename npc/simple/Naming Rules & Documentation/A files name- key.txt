Factionname_QuestID_FurtherQuestIDs_NPCname.npc 

To explain: 

First Part Factionname: 
CAD=NPC related to Cadomyr 
GAL= Galmair 
RUN=Runewick 
NOB=Noobia 
NON=No relation yet 
FRE="free" Npc, no faction affilation 

Second&Further Parts QuestID: 

Qxx=No Quest ID assigned yet 
Q<number>=NPC uses this QuestID 
TRA = Trader 

Last Part NPC Name: 

Self explenatory 

What I expect from this change is a better overview about which NPCs are related to which quest or town, and making it easier to see which Npcs aren't included anywhere at all until now. 

You can now use your windows explorer search function to search for i.e. all Npcs from Galmair, all NPCs related to the QuestID xy, and search as already possible before, by NPC name. 

Hope it helps, should for any reason this idea not be a good thing, a backup of the previous state is still in the repository. 

Cheers
