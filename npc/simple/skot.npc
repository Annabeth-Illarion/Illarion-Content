--Background:

--Skot was a young hero. He went on to be the savior of his mountain. He battled a demon using illusion magic,
--which he learned because he never wanted to actually hurt anybody. Skot lost, but the demon wanting to tear the
--hope of the sunny young man. The demon offered Skot a deal. He would spare the gnome’s mountain and its entire
--people if Skot would accept to be stricken with a disease. Courageous and hopeful Skot agreed. The demon plagued
--Skot with a very contagious form of leprosy. As per the deal the demon warned Skot if any of his skin came in
--contact with another it would kill them. The demon had to tell because if not it would count against the contract.
--The ever heroic Skot from that day forth covered up his skin and left the mountain to wander the world. He was
--eventually spotted by the previous Lifesage(before apple). The last Lifesage was impressed with Skot’s ability
--and had heard of his legend. The Lifesage had made it her lifelong duty to heal Skot, but that Lifesage was killed
--by Apple, the current Lifesage.
