-- Personality: There is not much complexity to this nine year old. She is happy, confident and extremely polite. She is a sole minded individual focused entirely on the art of cooking.
-- Background: She's a nine year old girl with both her parents. She grew up watching her father cook. At about 5 she started experimenting with the stove with the help of a ladder. Her parents were worried and especially freaked out after she burned her left hand at six. They banned her from the stove for a year; afterwards she badgered her mother who eventually let her back into the kitchen. She practiced cooking every day when the customers were not around. She soon outclassed her father in cooking skills and took over as the cook. Together all three of them make just enough money to get by, but it's a happy life, especially for Ce who has her parents and the esteem of being famous as the best cook in Cadomyr.
