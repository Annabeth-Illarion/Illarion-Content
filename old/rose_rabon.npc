-- Name: Rose Rabon
-- Occupation: hostess
-- Race: Human
-- Age: 26
-- Skin: Very dark
-- Hair: long black (fro)
-- Height: average
-- Weight: Slim

-- Cloth: Long sleeve black shirt. Brown leather pants

-- Personality: Rose is meek, cheerful and practical. It's a weird combination. Her daughter missed the practical and meek bit, but it works for Rose.

-- Background:  Rose was one of three children. She was the only girl and helped her dad take care of her diseased stricken mother. That would have been her Life, except on a trip to the bazaar she caught the eye of a sand rat cook. Their eyes met. She smiled. It was random, but the next day she was shocked to see him at her front door bartering with her father about a dowry. They married the next week. Part of the marriage deal was that he needed to get a house. They made a small hut together with their hands, blasting sand, chopping wood and tying twine. It was a great bonding experience.  Taking care of her husband was even more work than taking care of her ill mother. Kay was a slob, but Rose did not care. Life with him was heaven. Through his dreams and money, and her practicality and both working hard they turned their stand into a shop and their shop into a tavern. Now Life with him and their daughter, Linda is great. Rose takes the position of hostess; she greets the people upon entering with a smile. She directs those who are lost and new.
